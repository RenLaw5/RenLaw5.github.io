# MY PORTFOLIO WEB

My name is **Laura Fuentes**. I'm a Spanish girl looking forward to introduce myself in the world of software development. I'm very passionate about programming both front-end and back-end applications and working with professionals on the sector.

This project is my way to show what I've learnt as a presentation card in a simple way. I aim to keep upgrading it as I upgrade my skills and experience.

### Preview
This project aims to show what I've learnt about responsive design and scalable software. 
This is also my first Bootstrap 5 project to learn the basis at the same time I show my profile.  
I hope you enjoy my work as much as I did working on it.

### Features


### Used technologies
All this project technologies are pretty simple, I used only:

- HTML for the structure of the web.
- CSS to add some custom style.
- Bootstrap5 to keep a responsive design and make it easy to visualize on any device.
